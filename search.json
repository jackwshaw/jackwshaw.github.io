    "text": "Being from Kansas City, you’d think I’d be on the Mahomes bandwagon, chanting MVP every season, right? Well, not exactly. While both the media and Chiefs fans often paints Patrick Mahomes as the second coming of Jesus Christ, I’m at Arrowhead wearing the opponents jersey and doing everything in my power to cheer for them. I think Mahomes is just another system quarterback propped up by a stellar cast.\nEver since the NFL has partnered with Amazon to create NextGenStats, they have been tracking various different stats that never used to be tracked. One of these stats, which we will be specifically focusing on, is air yardage.\nNextGenStats defines the components we will be looking at as the following:\nAverage Completed Air Yards (CAY) and Average Intended Air Yards (IAY)\nAir Yards is the vertical yards on a pass attempt at the moment the ball is caught in relation to the line of scrimmage. CAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on completions, and IAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on all attempts. This metric shows how far the ball is being thrown ‘downfield’. Air Yards is recorded as a negative value when the pass is behind the Line of Scrimmage. Additionally Air Yards is calculated into the back of the end zone to better evaluate the true depth of the pass.\nAverage Air Yards Differential (AYD)\nAir Yards Differential is calculated by subtracting the passer’s average Intended Air Yards from his average Completed Air Yards. This stat indicates if he is on average attempting deep passes than he on average completes.\nSo what this means in English, it tracks how many yards the quarterback actually throws ball, and not how many extra yards the receiver picks up after the ball has been caught.\n\nMahomes’ AYD Since 2018—Not So Stellar?\nFirst up, let’s dissect Mahomes’s Average Air Yards Differential over the years alongside the league average. Does his performance truly eclipse that of his peers, or is it more about the system’s wings lifting him up?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nx2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2023.csv\")\n\nX2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2022.csv\")\n\nX2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2021.csv\")\n\nX2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2020.csv\")\n\nX2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2019.csv\")\n\nX2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2018.csv\")\n\nx2023 &lt;- x2023 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\nX2022 &lt;- X2022 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nX2021 &lt;- X2021 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nX2020 &lt;- X2020 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nX2019 &lt;- X2019 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  x2023,\n  X2022,\n  X2021,\n  X2020,\n  X2019,\n  X2018\n)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(x2023, X2022, X2021, X2020, X2019, X2018)\n\nmahomes_ayd &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt;\n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_AYD = mean(AYD, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"Mahomes AYD\")\n\nleague_avg_ayd &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(League_Average_AYD = mean(AYD, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"League Average AYD\")\n\ncombined_ayd &lt;- rbind(mahomes_ayd, league_avg_ayd |&gt; \n                        select(Season, Average_AYD = League_Average_AYD, Type))\n\ncolors &lt;- c(\"Mahomes AYD\" = \"#E31837\", \"League Average AYD\" = \"blue\")\n\nggplot(combined_ayd, aes(x = Season, y = Average_AYD, color = Type, group = Type)) + \n  geom_line(aes(linetype = Type), size = 1) +  # Use linetype to distinguish lines\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Mahomes AYD\" = \"solid\", \"League Average AYD\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Patrick Mahomes's AYD Over the Seasons Compared to League Average\",\n        caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n    x = \"Season\", \n    y = \"Average Air Yards Differential (AYD)\",\n    color = \"Type\",\n    linetype = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurns out, Mahomes has been, below average every season he’s started but one?

Surly I must not be talking about the same Patrick Mahomes that everyone else is.\n\n\nThe 2018 Hype Train\nRecall Mahomes’s supposed revolutionary 2018 season? Here’s how he stacked up against his counterparts based on total intended air yards from completions. Was he a genuine trailblazer or just a benefactor of an offense designed to make him look good?\n\n\nCode\nX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Completions = round(`COMP%` / 100 * ATT, 0),\n    TotalIntendedAirYards = Completions * IAY \n  )\n\nX2018_ranked_top32 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TotalIntendedAirYards)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |&gt; \n  filter(Rank &lt;= 32)\n\nggplot(X2018_ranked_top32, aes(x=reorder(`PLAYER NAME`, TotalIntendedAirYards), y=TotalIntendedAirYards, fill = `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\")) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"TRUE\"=\"#E31837\", \"FALSE\"=\"grey\")) +\n  labs(title=\"2018 QB Rankings by Total Intended Air Yards Based on Completions\", \n       subtitle=\"Highlighting Patrick Mahomes\",\n           caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n       x=\"\", y=\"Total Intended Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above is disceiving to the common fan. My uncles are seeing this chart and shoving it in my face right now. Don’t get to excited now gentlemen.\n\n\nReality Check—2023 Edition\nMoving to the present, how does Mahomes fare among his contemporaries this season? It’s time to see if the bubble bursts on the narrative of his dominance.\n\n\nCode\nX2023 &lt;- x2023 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Completions = round(`COMP%` / 100 * ATT, 0), # Calculate completions as a whole number\n    TotalIntendedAirYards = Completions * IAY # Calculate Total Intended Air Yards\n  )\n\nX2023_ranked_top32 &lt;- X2023 |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TotalIntendedAirYards)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |&gt; \n  filter(Rank &lt;= 32\n        )\n\nggplot(X2023_ranked_top32, aes(x=reorder(`PLAYER NAME`, TotalIntendedAirYards), y=TotalIntendedAirYards, fill = `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\")) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"TRUE\"=\"#E31837\", \"FALSE\"=\"grey\")) +\n  labs(title=\"2023 QB Rankings by Total Intended Air Yards Based on Completions\", \n       subtitle=\"Highlighting Patrick Mahomes\",\n       caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n       x=\"\", y=\"Total Intended Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what happened? How do we go from second in the league to middle of the pack behind names like Sam Howell and Derrick Carr who people claim “suck”. It wouldn’t be because the Chiefs got rid of arguably the leagues best and fastest player, right?\n\n\nMahomes With and Without His Star Receivers\nLet’s talk about Mahomes’ stats with and without Tyreek Hill, who was traded to the Miami Dolphins during the 2022 off season. Is Mahomes himself an all-star, or does he need star power around him to shine?\n\n\nCode\nwith_hill_data &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt; \n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\" & Season %in% 2018:2021)\n\nwithout_hill_data &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt; \n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\" & Season %in% 2022:2023)\n\nwith_hill_summary &lt;- with_hill_data |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AvgIAY = mean(IAY),\n    AvgCAY = mean(CAY)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(WithHill = \"With Hill (2018-2021)\")\n\nwithout_hill_summary &lt;- without_hill_data |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AvgIAY = mean(IAY),\n    AvgCAY = mean(CAY)\n  )  |&gt; \n  mutate(WithHill = \"Without Hill (2022-2023)\")\n\ncombined_summary &lt;- bind_rows(with_hill_summary, without_hill_summary)\n\ncombined_summary_long &lt;- pivot_longer(combined_summary, c(AvgIAY, AvgCAY), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(combined_summary_long, aes(x = Metric, y = Value, fill = WithHill)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"With Hill (2018-2021)\" = \"#E31837\", \"Without Hill (2022-2023)\" = \"#008E97\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Mahomes's Air Yards With and Without Tyreek Hill\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing Average Intended and Completed Air Yards\",\n           caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n       x = \"\", y = \"Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou thought this was something?

Not Mahomes.\n\n\nCode\nsuperbowl_wins &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(\"Tom Brady\", \"Patrick Mahomes\"),\n  SuperBowlWins = c(7, 3)  # Update Mahomes' wins as necessary\n)\n\n\nggplot(superbowl_wins, aes(x = Player, y = SuperBowlWins, fill = Player)) + \n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Tom Brady\" = \"#002244\", \"Patrick Mahomes\" = \"#E31837\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(superbowl_wins$SuperBowlWins) + 1, by = 1)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Super Bowl Wins Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"In Order to be the GOAT, you Must Beat him.\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Number of Super Bowl Wins\",\n    caption = \"Source: NFL records | By: Jack Shaw\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo at the end of the day when it’s all said and done, I have, do, and always will downplay the fanfare around Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. Just know that it’s only a matter of time before Jordan Love takes over the National Football League."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the high-stakes world of professional football, the quarterback position is king. With the 2024 NFL Draft ushering in a new wave of talent, football fans are looking forward to the debuts of six first-round quarterbacks. But how do these rookies compare to their more experienced predecessors? Let’s look at the data to see what’s going on with these bright young quarterbacks and their more established rivals.\nYards per attempt: Measuring passing efficiency\nYards per attempt is a measure of a quarterback’s passing efficiency, defining the balance between gaining large yardage and reducing interception risk. When we compare the rookie quarterbacks’ yards per attempt to those of their predecessors, interesting trends emerge. From Michael Penix Jr.’s explosive downfield passing to JJ McCarthy’s surgical perfection, each rookie has a unique flair on the field. How do these newbies compare to seasoned veterans like Russell Wilson and Kirk Cousins in this crucial facet of quarterback performance?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nQBStats&lt;- read_csv(\"QBStats.csv\")\n\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\"Bears\" = \"#0B162A\", \"Broncos\" = \"#FB4F14\", \"Vikings\" = \"#4F2683\",\"Commanders\" = \"#5A1414\", \"Falcons\" = \"#A71930\", \"Patriots\"= \"#B0B7BC\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = QBStats, aes(x = reorder(Player, `Yards/Attempt`), y = `Yards/Attempt`, fill = `Team/School`), position = position_dodge()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  labs(title = \"Yards per Attempt Comparison\", \n       subtitle = \"Examining Yards per Attempt Across Quarterbacks and Teams\",\n       x = \"Quarterback\", \n       y = \"Yards per Attempt\",\n       caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Jack Shaw\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final chart examines yards per attempt across the board. Here, Caleb Williams and Bo Nix shine, suggesting that their play style not only emphasizes accuracy but also an ability to drive the ball downfield. Such attributes can translate into explosive plays, which are key components of winning games in the NFL.\nCompletion Percentage: A Measure of Accuracy\nElite quarterbacks are known for their accuracy, and their completion % reflects their ability to deliver accurate throws to their intended targets. As we compare the rookie quarterbacks’ completion percentages to those of their predecessors, we discover surprising trends. How do newbies Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels stack up against seasoned veterans Justin Fields and Sam Howell in terms of accuracy?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = QBStats, aes(x = reorder(Player, `Completion %`), y = `Completion %`, group = 1, color = `Team/School`), size = 1) +\n  geom_point(data = QBStats, aes(x = reorder(Player, `Completion %`), y = `Completion %`, color = `Team/School`), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  labs(title = \"Completion Percentage Comparison\", \n       subtitle = \"Analyzing Completion Percentage Across Quarterbacks\",\n       x = \"Quarterback\", \n       y = \"Completion Percentage (%)\",\n       caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Jack Shaw\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend line in this chart offers a straightforward visual of completion percentage across quarterbacks. The rookies, particularly JJ McCarthy and Bo Nix, demonstrate high completion percentages, which are indicative of accuracy and possibly a quick adaptation to the NFL’s demands, an essential trait for success in professional leagues.\nComparing Quarterback Ratings: Assessing Overall Performance\nQuarterback rating provides a thorough assessment of a quarterback’s performance, taking into account metrics such as passing efficiency, touchdown-to-interception ratio, and overall effectiveness. By comparing the rookie quarterback ratings to those of their predecessors, we can acquire useful insights into their respective contributions on the field. Do these rookies have the capacity to rise to the level of experienced stars such as Mac Jones and Desmond Ridder? Or will they have difficulty adapting to the demands of the NFL?\n\n\nCode\nQBStats &lt;- QBStats |&gt; \n  mutate(Player = reorder(Player, Rating))\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_segment(data = QBStats, aes(x = Player, xend = Player, y = 0, yend = Rating, color = `Team/School`)) +\n  geom_point(data = QBStats, aes(x = Player, y = Rating, color = `Team/School`), size = 4) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  labs(title = \"Quarterback Ratings\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing Quarterback Ratings Across Players\",\n       x = \"Quarterback\",\n       y = \"Rating\",\n       caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Jack Shaw\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comparison of quarterback ratings clearly delineates the high ceiling of rookies like Caleb Williams and JJ McCarthy. Their high ratings suggest that they are well-prepared to make an immediate impact. This could be particularly crucial for teams like the Vikings and Broncos looking for a fresh start under center.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = QBStats, aes(x = `Yards/Attempt`, y = `Completion %`, color = `Team/School`), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  geom_text(data = QBStats, aes(x = `Yards/Attempt`, y = `Completion %`, label = Player), vjust = -0.1, hjust = 1.15, size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Yards per Attempt vs Completion Percentage\",\n       subtitle = \"Analyzing Quarterback Performance in Passing Efficiency\",\n       x = \"Yards per Attempt\",\n       y = \"Completion Percentage\",\n       caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Jack Shaw\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(5, NA)) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on passing efficiency, this graph reveals interesting contrasts in styles. Bo Nix and Jayden Daniels show high completion percentages coupled with aggressive yards per attempt, positioning them as likely efficient passers for their teams. The data implies that these players could offer reliable, high-impact passing options compared to some incumbents like Russell Wilson and Kirk Cousins, who exhibit less efficiency in these metrics.\nTD to INT Ratio and Adjusted Yards/Attempt: Exploring Efficiency\nIn the pursuit of quarterback brilliance, a balance between touchdown passes and interceptions is critical. This measure, along with adjusted yards per attempt, which takes into account the quality of each passing attempt, provides a more sophisticated picture of quarterback efficiency. What are the rookie quarterbacks’ touchdown-to-interception ratios and adjusted yards per attempt compared to their predecessors? Is there evidence of future success or room for growth in their performance?\n\n\nCode\nQBStats &lt;- QBStats |&gt; \n  mutate(TD_INT_Ratio = TDs / Interceptions)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = QBStats, aes(x = TD_INT_Ratio, y = `Adjusted Yards/Attempt`, size = Interceptions, color = `Team/School`), alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(3, 10)) +\n  labs(title = \"TD to INT Ratio vs Adjusted Yards/Attempt\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparison of TD to INT Ratio and Adjusted Yards/Attempt for Quarterbacks\",\n       x = \"TD/INT Ratio\",\n       y = \"Adjusted Yards/Attempt\",\n       size = \"Interceptions\",\n       color = \"Team\",\n       caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By: Jack Shaw\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = QBStats, aes(x = TD_INT_Ratio, y = `Adjusted Yards/Attempt`, label = Player), \n                  box.padding = unit(0.2, \"lines\"), size = 3) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart provides a comparison between the touchdown-to-interception (TD/INT) ratio and adjusted yards per attempt for each quarterback, highlighting both the rookies and their predecessors. Notably, Caleb Williams stands out with an impressive combination of high adjusted yards per attempt and a strong TD/INT ratio, suggesting a potentially transformative impact for the Bears. Jayden Daniels also shows promise with similar metrics, potentially providing a significant upgrade for the Falcons.\nGeneral Analysis\nAcross the charts, the rookies, especially Caleb Williams, Bo Nix, and Jayden Daniels, show metrics that either meet or exceed those of their more seasoned counterparts. This bodes well for their teams, suggesting that the draft picks might pay off quicker than expected, with potential immediate impacts on the field.\nThis narrative structure should give your readers a clear understanding of the metrics and how these relate to both individual and team prospects, driving home the significance of these first-round picks."
