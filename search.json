    "text": "Being from Kansas City, you’d think I’d be on the Mahomes bandwagon, chanting MVP every season, right? Well, not exactly. While both the media and Chiefs fans often paints Patrick Mahomes as the second coming of Jesus Christ, I’m at Arrowhead wearing the opponents jersey and doing everything in my power to cheer for them. I think Mahomes is just another system quarterback propped up by a stellar cast.\nEver since the NFL has partnered with Amazon to create NextGenStats, they have been tracking various different stats that never used to be tracked. One of these stats, which we will be specifically focusing on, is air yardage.\nNextGenStats defines the components we will be looking at as the following:\nAverage Completed Air Yards (CAY) and Average Intended Air Yards (IAY)\nAir Yards is the vertical yards on a pass attempt at the moment the ball is caught in relation to the line of scrimmage. CAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on completions, and IAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on all attempts. This metric shows how far the ball is being thrown ‘downfield’. Air Yards is recorded as a negative value when the pass is behind the Line of Scrimmage. Additionally Air Yards is calculated into the back of the end zone to better evaluate the true depth of the pass.\nAverage Air Yards Differential (AYD)\nAir Yards Differential is calculated by subtracting the passer’s average Intended Air Yards from his average Completed Air Yards. This stat indicates if he is on average attempting deep passes than he on average completes.\nSo what this means in English, it tracks how many yards the quarterback actually throws ball, and not how many extra yards the receiver picks up after the ball has been caught.\n\nMahomes’ AYD Since 2018—Not So Stellar?\nFirst up, let’s dissect Mahomes’s Average Air Yards Differential over the years alongside the league average. Does his performance truly eclipse that of his peers, or is it more about the system’s wings lifting him up?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nx2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2023.csv\")\n\nX2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2022.csv\")\n\nX2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2021.csv\")\n\nX2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2020.csv\")\n\nX2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2019.csv\")\n\nX2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2018.csv\")\n\nx2023 &lt;- x2023 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\nX2022 &lt;- X2022 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nX2021 &lt;- X2021 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nX2020 &lt;- X2020 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nX2019 &lt;- X2019 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  x2023,\n  X2022,\n  X2021,\n  X2020,\n  X2019,\n  X2018\n)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(x2023, X2022, X2021, X2020, X2019, X2018)\n\nmahomes_ayd &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt;\n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_AYD = mean(AYD, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"Mahomes AYD\")\n\nleague_avg_ayd &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(League_Average_AYD = mean(AYD, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"League Average AYD\")\n\ncombined_ayd &lt;- rbind(mahomes_ayd, league_avg_ayd |&gt; \n                        select(Season, Average_AYD = League_Average_AYD, Type))\n\ncolors &lt;- c(\"Mahomes AYD\" = \"#E31837\", \"League Average AYD\" = \"blue\")\n\nggplot(combined_ayd, aes(x = Season, y = Average_AYD, color = Type, group = Type)) + \n  geom_line(aes(linetype = Type), size = 1) +  # Use linetype to distinguish lines\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Mahomes AYD\" = \"solid\", \"League Average AYD\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Patrick Mahomes's AYD Over the Seasons Compared to League Average\",\n        caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n    x = \"Season\", \n    y = \"Average Air Yards Differential (AYD)\",\n    color = \"Type\",\n    linetype = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurns out, Mahomes has been, below average every season he’s started but one? That can’t be, I thought he can’t do anything wrong!\n\n\nAll That Glitters Is Not Gold\nDiving deeper, we explore his intended versus completed air yards across each season. These breakdowns peel back whether those flashy, long-bomb highlights are as accurate as advertised, or if they’re just smoke and mirrors.\n\n\nCode\nXX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\nXX2019 &lt;- X2019 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nXX2020 &lt;- X2020|&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nXX2021 &lt;- X2021 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nXX2022 &lt;- X2022 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nXX2023 &lt;- x2023|&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(XX2018, XX2019, XX2020, XX2021, XX2022, XX2023)\n\nggplot(all_qb_data, aes(x=IAY, y=CAY)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\"), size=3) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = filter(all_qb_data, `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\"),\n    aes(x = IAY, y = CAY, label = `PLAYER NAME`), \n    box.padding = .35,\n    point.padding = .5,\n    segment.color = 'grey50'\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"grey\", \"TRUE\" = \"#E31837\")) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Intended Air Yards (IAY) vs. Completed Air Yards (CAY) for NFL QBs\",\n    subtitle = \"Highlighting Patrick Mahomes Across Seasons\",\n    caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n    x = \"Average Intended Air Yards (IAY)\",\n    y = \"Average Completed Air Yards (CAY)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~Season) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle of the pack or worse each season? Surly I must not be talking about the same Patrick Mahomes that everyone else is.\n\n\nThe 2018 Hype Train\nRecall Mahomes’s supposed revolutionary 2018 season? Here’s how he stacked up against his counterparts based on total intended air yards from completions. Was he a genuine trailblazer or just a benefactor of an offense designed to make him look good?\n\n\nCode\nX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Completions = round(`COMP%` / 100 * ATT, 0),\n    TotalIntendedAirYards = Completions * IAY \n  )\n\nX2018_ranked_top32 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TotalIntendedAirYards)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |&gt; \n  filter(Rank &lt;= 32)\n\nggplot(X2018_ranked_top32, aes(x=reorder(`PLAYER NAME`, TotalIntendedAirYards), y=TotalIntendedAirYards, fill = `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\")) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"TRUE\"=\"#E31837\", \"FALSE\"=\"grey\")) +\n  labs(title=\"2018 QB Rankings by Total Intended Air Yards Based on Completions\", \n       subtitle=\"Highlighting Patrick Mahomes\",\n           caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n       x=\"\", y=\"Total Intended Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above is disceiving to the common fan. My uncles are seeing this chart and shoving it in my face right now. Don’t get to excited now gentlemen.\n\n\nReality Check—2023 Edition\nMoving to the present, how does Mahomes fare among his contemporaries this season? It’s time to see if the bubble bursts on the narrative of his dominance.\n\n\nCode\nX2023 &lt;- x2023 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Completions = round(`COMP%` / 100 * ATT, 0), # Calculate completions as a whole number\n    TotalIntendedAirYards = Completions * IAY # Calculate Total Intended Air Yards\n  )\n\nX2023_ranked_top32 &lt;- X2023 |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TotalIntendedAirYards)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |&gt; \n  filter(Rank &lt;= 32\n        )\n\nggplot(X2023_ranked_top32, aes(x=reorder(`PLAYER NAME`, TotalIntendedAirYards), y=TotalIntendedAirYards, fill = `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\")) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"TRUE\"=\"#E31837\", \"FALSE\"=\"grey\")) +\n  labs(title=\"2023 QB Rankings by Total Intended Air Yards Based on Completions\", \n       subtitle=\"Highlighting Patrick Mahomes\",\n       caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n       x=\"\", y=\"Total Intended Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what happened? How do we go from second in the league to middle of the pack behind names like Sam Howell and Derrick Carr who people claim “suck”. It wouldn’t be because the Chiefs got rid of arguably the leagues best and fastest player, right?\n\n\nMahomes With and Without His Star Receivers\nLet’s talk about Mahomes’ stats with and without Tyreek Hill, who was traded to the Miami Dolphins during the 2022 off season. Is Mahomes himself an all-star, or does he need star power around him to shine?\n\n\nCode\nwith_hill_data &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt; \n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\" & Season %in% 2018:2021)\n\nwithout_hill_data &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt; \n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\" & Season %in% 2022:2023)\n\nwith_hill_summary &lt;- with_hill_data |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AvgIAY = mean(IAY),\n    AvgCAY = mean(CAY)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(WithHill = \"With Hill (2018-2021)\")\n\nwithout_hill_summary &lt;- without_hill_data |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AvgIAY = mean(IAY),\n    AvgCAY = mean(CAY)\n  )  |&gt; \n  mutate(WithHill = \"Without Hill (2022-2023)\")\n\ncombined_summary &lt;- bind_rows(with_hill_summary, without_hill_summary)\n\ncombined_summary_long &lt;- pivot_longer(combined_summary, c(AvgIAY, AvgCAY), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(combined_summary_long, aes(x = Metric, y = Value, fill = WithHill)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"With Hill (2018-2021)\" = \"#E31837\", \"Without Hill (2022-2023)\" = \"#008E97\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Mahomes's Air Yards With and Without Tyreek Hill\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing Average Intended and Completed Air Yards\",\n           caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n       x = \"\", y = \"Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou thought this was something? Wait until Travis Kelce decides it’s time to make his debut on the Era’s Tour permanently with girlfriend Taylor Swift.\n\n\nThe Stat to Shut Chiefs Fans up.\nAt the end of the day Chiefs fans, who is, and always WILL BE the true GOAT? Not Mahomes.\n\n\nCode\nsuperbowl_wins &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(\"Tom Brady\", \"Patrick Mahomes\"),\n  SuperBowlWins = c(7, 3)  # Update Mahomes' wins as necessary\n)\n\n\nggplot(superbowl_wins, aes(x = Player, y = SuperBowlWins, fill = Player)) + \n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Tom Brady\" = \"#002244\", \"Patrick Mahomes\" = \"#E31837\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(superbowl_wins$SuperBowlWins) + 1, by = 1)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Super Bowl Wins Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"In Order to be the GOAT, you Must Beat him.\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Number of Super Bowl Wins\",\n    caption = \"Source: NFL records | By: Jack Shaw\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo at the end of the day when it’s all said and done, I have, do, and always will downplay the fanfare around Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. Just know that it’s only a matter of time before Jordan Love takes over the National Football League."
