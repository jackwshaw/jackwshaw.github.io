    "text": "Is Patrick Mahomes Actually the Most Overrated QB of all time?\n\nAs someone who has grown up in Kansas City his whole life, I must be very pleased with the success of the Kansas City Chiefs and star Quarterback Patrick Mahomes, right?\nWrong. Extremely wrong. I dispise the Chiefs and quite frankly think that Mahomes has been bailed out by what he has to work with his whole career.\nPart of this is because I am the only member of my family who hates Mahomes and the Chiefs and I’ve always been trying to have facts that I can at least attempt to prove the delusional Chiefs fan wrong.\nEver since the NFL has partnered with Amazon to create NextGenStats, they have been tracking various different stats that used to not be tracked. One of these, which we will be specifically taking a look at, is air yardage.\nNextGenStats defines the components we will be looking at as the following:\nAverage Completed Air Yards (CAY) and Average Intended Air Yards (IAY)\nAir Yards is the vertical yards on a pass attempt at the moment the ball is caught in relation to the line of scrimmage. CAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on completions, and IAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on all attempts. This metric shows how far the ball is being thrown ‘downfield’. Air Yards is recorded as a negative value when the pass is behind the Line of Scrimmage. Additionally Air Yards is calculated into the back of the end zone to better evaluate the true depth of the pass.\nAverage Air Yards Differential (AYD)\nAir Yards Differential is calculated by subtracting the passer’s average Intended Air Yards from his average Completed Air Yards. This stat indicates if he is on average attempting deep passes than he on average completes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nx2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2023.csv\")\n\nX2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2022.csv\")\n\nX2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2021.csv\")\n\nX2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2020.csv\")\n\nX2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2019.csv\")\n\nX2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2018.csv\")\n\nx2023 &lt;- x2023 |&gt;
