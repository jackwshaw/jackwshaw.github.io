    "text": "Being from Kansas City, you’d think I’d be on the Mahomes bandwagon, chanting MVP every season, right? Well, not exactly. While the media and Chiefs fans often paints Patrick Mahomes as the second coming of Jesus Christ, I’m at Arrowhead wearing the opponents jersey and doing everything in my power to cheer for them. I think Mahomes is just another system quarterback propped up by a stellar cast.\nEver since the NFL has partnered with Amazon to create NextGenStats, they have been tracking various different stats that used to not be tracked. One of these, which we will be specifically taking a look at, is air yardage.\nNextGenStats defines the components we will be looking at as the following:\nAverage Completed Air Yards (CAY) and Average Intended Air Yards (IAY)\nAir Yards is the vertical yards on a pass attempt at the moment the ball is caught in relation to the line of scrimmage. CAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on completions, and IAY shows the average Air Yards a passer throws on all attempts. This metric shows how far the ball is being thrown ‘downfield’. Air Yards is recorded as a negative value when the pass is behind the Line of Scrimmage. Additionally Air Yards is calculated into the back of the end zone to better evaluate the true depth of the pass.\nAverage Air Yards Differential (AYD)\nAir Yards Differential is calculated by subtracting the passer’s average Intended Air Yards from his average Completed Air Yards. This stat indicates if he is on average attempting deep passes than he on average completes.\nSo what this means in English, it tracks how many yards the quarterback actually throws ball, and not how many extra yards the receiver picks up after the ball has been caught.\n\nMahomes’ AYD Since 2018—Not So Stellar?\nLet’s start by stripping down the glitz of those no-look passes. The first chart lays out Mahomes’s Average Air Yards Differential over the years alongside the league average. Does he consistently outperform his peers, or does he ride the wave of a system tailored to inflate his stats?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nx2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2023.csv\")\n\nX2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2022.csv\")\n\nX2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2021.csv\")\n\nX2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2020.csv\")\n\nX2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2019.csv\")\n\nX2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"Next Gen Stats data - 2018.csv\")\n\nx2023 &lt;- x2023 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\nX2022 &lt;- X2022 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nX2021 &lt;- X2021 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nX2020 &lt;- X2020 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nX2019 &lt;- X2019 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  x2023,\n  X2022,\n  X2021,\n  X2020,\n  X2019,\n  X2018\n)\n\nall_qb_data &lt;- bind_rows(x2023, X2022, X2021, X2020, X2019, X2018)\n\nmahomes_ayd &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt;\n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(Average_AYD = mean(AYD, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"Mahomes AYD\")\n\nleague_avg_ayd &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(League_Average_AYD = mean(AYD, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"League Average AYD\")\n\ncombined_ayd &lt;- rbind(mahomes_ayd, league_avg_ayd |&gt; \n                        select(Season, Average_AYD = League_Average_AYD, Type))\n\ncolors &lt;- c(\"Mahomes AYD\" = \"#E31837\", \"League Average AYD\" = \"blue\")\n\nggplot(combined_ayd, aes(x = Season, y = Average_AYD, color = Type, group = Type)) + \n  geom_line(aes(linetype = Type), size = 1) +  # Use linetype to distinguish lines\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Mahomes AYD\" = \"solid\", \"League Average AYD\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Patrick Mahomes's AYD Over the Seasons Compared to League Average\",\n        caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n    x = \"Season\", \n    y = \"Average Air Yards Differential (AYD)\",\n    color = \"Type\",\n    linetype = \"Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll That Glitters Is Not Gold\nNext up, we break down his intended vs. completed air yards, season by season.

This chart ranks him against other QBs based on total intended air yards derived from completions. Was he genuinely revolutionary, or just good at capitalizing on a system beefed up to make him look good?\n\n\nCode\nX2018 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Completions = round(`COMP%` / 100 * ATT, 0),\n    TotalIntendedAirYards = Completions * IAY \n  )\n\nX2018_ranked_top32 &lt;- X2018 |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TotalIntendedAirYards)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |&gt; \n  filter(Rank &lt;= 32)\n\nggplot(X2018_ranked_top32, aes(x=reorder(`PLAYER NAME`, TotalIntendedAirYards), y=TotalIntendedAirYards, fill = `PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\")) + \n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"TRUE\"=\"#E31837\", \"FALSE\"=\"grey\")) +\n  labs(title=\"2018 QB Rankings by Total Intended Air Yards Based on Completions\", \n       subtitle=\"Highlighting Patrick Mahomes\",\n           caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n       x=\"\", y=\"Total Intended Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReality Check—2023 Edition\nFast forward to now—where does Mahomes stand among his contemporaries in the 2023 season?

These bars show how his air yards pan out with the speedster on the field versus without. Is Mahomes himself an all-star, or does he need star power around him to shine?\n\n\nCode\nwith_hill_data &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt; \n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\" & Season %in% 2018:2021)\n\nwithout_hill_data &lt;- all_qb_data |&gt; \n  filter(`PLAYER NAME` == \"Patrick Mahomes\" & Season %in% 2022:2023)\n\nwith_hill_summary &lt;- with_hill_data |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AvgIAY = mean(IAY),\n    AvgCAY = mean(CAY)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(WithHill = \"With Hill (2018-2021)\")\n\nwithout_hill_summary &lt;- without_hill_data |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AvgIAY = mean(IAY),\n    AvgCAY = mean(CAY)\n  )  |&gt; \n  mutate(WithHill = \"Without Hill (2022-2023)\")\n\ncombined_summary &lt;- bind_rows(with_hill_summary, without_hill_summary)\n\ncombined_summary_long &lt;- pivot_longer(combined_summary, c(AvgIAY, AvgCAY), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nggplot(combined_summary_long, aes(x = Metric, y = Value, fill = WithHill)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"With Hill (2018-2021)\" = \"#E31837\", \"Without Hill (2022-2023)\" = \"#008E97\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Mahomes's Air Yards With and Without Tyreek Hill\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing Average Intended and Completed Air Yards\",\n           caption = \"Source: nextgenstats.nfl.com | By: Jack Shaw\",\n\n       x = \"\", y = \"Air Yards\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMahomes vs. Brady\nFinally, no debate is complete without bringing Tom Brady into the mix. Here’s a comparison of Super Bowl wins between Brady and Mahomes. It’s clear who the real G.O.A.T is, and spoiler alert: it’s not the guy from KC.\n\n\nCode\nsuperbowl_wins &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(\"Tom Brady\", \"Patrick Mahomes\"),\n  SuperBowlWins = c(7, 3)  # Update Mahomes' wins as necessary\n)\n\n\nggplot(superbowl_wins, aes(x = Player, y = SuperBowlWins, fill = Player)) + \n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Tom Brady\" = \"#002244\", \"Patrick Mahomes\" = \"#E31837\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(superbowl_wins$SuperBowlWins) + 1, by = 1)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Super Bowl Wins Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Tom Brady vs. Patrick Mahomes\",\n    x = \"Player\",\n    y = \"Number of Super Bowl Wins\",\n    caption = \"Source: NFL records | By: Jack Shaw\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )"
